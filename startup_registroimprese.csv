The platform carefully selects and gathers together certified SME farm suppliers with particular attention to the raw materials used (Italian origin exclusively), to guarantees quality, health and well-being to the final customer: 'One Stop Shop of Health & Quality'. 

The Goal is to bring together into ONE single 'online marketplace' the best 'Made in Italy‘ production of small and medium-sized agricultual farm suppliers that focus on quality and the ingredients used with respect of the environment, for the purpose of enhancing local territories natural features.","Closest Competitor:

1. Sorgente Natura > already established company started as offline shop now they focus on online mostly with 1000s of organic products. They offer organic products from Ita/EU/nonEU. They do not focus on Italian organic and they do not have an international focus.
2.  NaturaSI > NaturaSi is the ""physical"" store which highlights organic products to customers. Golditaly is positioned as an alternate ""digital"" to NaturaSi, with the upside represented its esclusive 100% Made in italy selection and international focus. NaturaSi could rappresent a distribution channel on the offline Golditaly branded products.
3. Foodscovery > is a B2C platform for gastronomic products in Abruzzo, they opened a B2B business line for high-end products, however, they do not really compete as real competitor due to the very selective natare of Golditaly organic food & beverage,  Foodscovery do not focus on organic 100% made in Italy, and they do not have any international focus.
4. Amazon> World leader eCommerce with CAC costs and UX dynamics that cannot be attacked by other competitors. However, the platform can be an important source engaging users who would like pay more attention to particular products related to organic quality selection and well-being.  Golditaly invests part of its resources in the development of healthy and organic scientific content that engage a more dedicated audience with exclusive personal advantages.

In Italy several eCommerce websites have been created for the sale of organic / gourmet food and beverage products, such as (Sorgente Natura) or offline channels (NaturaSi) and many small others (most of them operates in dropshipping methods).

Only Golditaly selects only 100% made in Italy (Bio / Gourmet) certificates, has a B2C and B2B sales focus at an international level, with a full logistic and integrated warehouse. Furthermore, technologies will be introduced in the business plan to support the traceability of the partner producers' certification to create an exclusive HUB of controlled origin products."

For this reason, it is possible to state that at present there are no competitors within the reference market that can be defined as direct, or companies that offer the public a product similar to that of the startup. Therefore, the competition that will have to be faced with the establishment of the company can be traced only to indirect competitors, who, by definition, offer similar products (so-called substitutes). In this context, it is therefore possible to identify the competition relating to the rental of the Green Rooms essentially in 2 companies operating in the Italian market: IGROX srl and TOMATOPIU srl.
IGROX srl is a company already structured in the marketing of containers and plants, designed for indoor and controlled environment cultivation of plants.
TOMATOPIU srl, is characterized by an activity focused on the manufacture and marketing of structures for cultivation in a controlled environment."
